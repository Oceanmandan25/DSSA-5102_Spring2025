#Data Warehousing and Gathering

##Where is the data from
This data was sourced from Marvel.com

##How was it collected
The data was taken from a Kaggle dataset

##How was it extracted
Data from the Marvel website is extracted via the Marvel Web API

##What program was used to clean the data?
Jupyter Notebook was used to clean the data

##How was the data cleaned/transformed?
All column names were standardized to lowercase and remove spaces
The published_date column was altered from a object type to a date column to facilitate future manipulation.
The year in each row of the published_date column was seperated into a new column to better display total publications by year
The price column was manipulated to remove books with no given price (i.e. none written), and books with a written price of "free" were changed to a monetary value of 0.00
Dollar signs were removed from all rows in the price column in order to turn the column from an object to numeric column
The rating system, which included many duplicate versions of the same rating (i.e. RATED T, Rated T, rated t, etc.) was standardized to replace all duplicate ratings

##What are the units for the numeric data
The main numeric column in the data set is the price column, making the units US dollars

##What are the formulas used in column creation
When creating the year column from the published_date column using the pd.to.datetime function from the pandas package. 
Following this, the published date column was modified via the __dt.year function to seperate the year into a new column on its own
